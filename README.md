# GlowDocket

GlowDocket is a browser-local assignment planner built for students. It combines assignment tracking, due-date planning, course organization, independent checklists, calendar views, recommendations, workspace widgets, personalization, archive/trash recovery, and optional browser notifications in one React application.

User-facing errors should explain what happened, whether work remains safe on the device, and what the user can do next. Provider names, request details, identifiers, and raw service errors belong only in developer logs or protected diagnostics—not ordinary interface copy.

## Run locally

Requirements: a current Node.js release and npm.

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful verification commands:

```powershell
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

`npm run dev:vercel` is only needed when testing Vercel functions locally.

## Architecture

- `src/App.jsx` contains the shared React state and the main product workflows: local accounts, assignments, courses, settings, widgets, calendar, checklists, imports, attachments, archive, and trash.
- `src/App.css` contains the application theme, responsive layout, widget, modal, calendar, settings, and task-card styles.
- `src/workspaceLayout.js` is the source of truth for widget defaults, sizing, placement, collapse behavior, migration, and desktop/mobile layouts.
- `src/*Utils.js` modules contain pure date, ranking, import, and voice-undo logic. These functions are covered by `tests/workspace.test.js`.
- `public/sw.js` provides the production-only network-first service worker and installable app shell.
- `api/voice-assignments.js` is an optional Vercel audio-processing endpoint. The current UI primarily uses the browser's built-in speech-recognition API.

## Browser-local data

GlowDocket stores product data in the current browser. Signing in selects a local profile; it does not create a cloud account. Important per-profile data includes:

- assignments and their archive/trash state;
- courses and course colors;
- settings and personalization;
- standalone checklists;
- desktop and mobile widget layouts.

Attachments are stored in IndexedDB. Compatibility-sensitive keys still use the historical `taskacadia_` prefix and should not be renamed without a data migration. Clearing site data removes locally stored GlowDocket information.

## Major product areas

- **Dashboard:** Recommended Plan of Attack, What Should I Do, reminders, course overview, statistics, mini calendar, and movable widgets.
- **Assignments:** To Do, In Progress, Completed, repeating work, estimates, priorities, notes, links, files, and checklist steps.
- **Calendar:** fixed full-calendar month/week views plus a movable dashboard mini calendar.
- **Checklists:** independent colored lists with optional deadlines and reminders.
- **Settings:** assignment defaults, field visibility, calendar behavior, notifications, school cycles, appearance, custom themes, archive, trash, and workspace guidance.
- **Storage safety:** browser quota monitoring, local backup recovery, and attachment limits of 10 MB per file, 10 files, and 50 MB per assignment.
- **Accessibility verification:** an on-demand automated DOM check plus a saved manual checklist for keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, contrast, motion, dialog, mobile, and touch testing.
- **Crash recovery:** a top-level React error boundary keeps unexpected interface failures from becoming a blank screen and can reload directly into Backup & Restore without clearing planner data.

Assignments moved to Trash remain recoverable for 30 days. GlowDocket permanently removes expired Trash assignments the next time the app is open (and checks hourly while it remains open), including attachment blobs that are no longer referenced by another assignment. The deletion then follows the normal local/cloud sync path.
- **Imports:** pasted assignment lists and local PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, or CSV syllabus extraction.

## Voice assignments

Voice assignment creation is currently disabled and marked **In the works**. The manual, paste, bulk-import, and syllabus assignment paths remain available.

## Deployment

The application is configured for Vite and Vercel. A production build is created with:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Vercel can deploy the generated application from the connected repository. The service worker is registered only in production builds.

## Installing GlowDocket

- **Desktop Chrome or Edge:** use the address-bar install icon or the browser menu and choose **Install GlowDocket** / **Install app**.
- **Android:** open the browser's three-dot menu and choose **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**.
- **iPhone or iPad:** open GlowDocket in Safari, tap **Share**, choose **Add to Home Screen**, and launch it from the new Home Screen icon. Open the installed version before enabling push reminders.

Installation wording and availability vary by browser. A normal browser tab continues to work if installation is unavailable.

## Optional external reminders

GlowDocket can use OneSignal Web Push for assignment reminders while the app is closed. Full assignments remain in the browser. Supabase stores only an opaque profile-installation ID, task/occurrence identifiers, OneSignal subscription and message IDs, title, course, deadline, timezone, lead time, revision, and scheduling/cleanup state. Notification text may appear on a device lock screen.

### OneSignal setup

1. Create a OneSignal Web app for the exact production origin. HTTPS and an exact origin match are required.
2. Set the worker path to `/push/onesignal/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` and its scope to `/push/onesignal/`.
3. Keep GlowDocket's `/sw.js` worker enabled; the narrower OneSignal scope prevents a registration conflict.
4. Put the public App ID in `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`. Put the server API key only in `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`.
5. On iPhone/iPad, install GlowDocket to the Home Screen and open the installed app before enabling Push Reminders.

### Supabase registry

1. Create or select a Supabase project.
2. Review and run `supabase/migrations/202607120001_create_push_reminder_registry.sql` in that project. Codex does not run it automatically.
3. Set `SUPABASE_URL` to the base project URL in the exact form `https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co`. Do not include `/rest/v1`; the Supabase client appends that path. Set `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` only in the Vercel server environment. It means the current server secret/service-role credential supplied by Supabase; never expose it through a `VITE_` variable.
4. The migration enables RLS and revokes browser roles. Only Vercel Functions use the registry.

### Environment and cron

Copy `.env.example` for names and placeholders. Public variables are `VITE_EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED` and `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`. Server-only variables are `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`, `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`, `PUSH_SIGNING_SECRET`, `PUSH_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, `EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and `CRON_SECRET`.

`vercel.json` invokes `GET /api/reminders/process-horizon` once daily at `17 6 * * *` (06:17 UTC), compatible with Vercel Hobby's daily cron limit. Vercel sends `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`; the endpoint rejects requests without an exact match. Reminders more than 28 days away remain `pending_horizon` until a daily run promotes them.

### Local testing and production review

The React UI can run locally, but real closed-app delivery requires a configured OneSignal origin, Supabase registry, server environment, notification permission, internet access, and compatible browser/OS settings. Before production, test enable/disable, test push, add/edit/complete/delete/restore, repeating occurrences, lead-time changes, offline cleanup retry, subscription refresh, cron promotion, lock-screen wording, and notification clicks on supported desktop browsers, Android PWA, and iOS Home Screen.

### Kill switches and rollback

- `VITE_EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED=false` hides/disables new browser enrollment controls after rebuilding.
- `EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED=false` blocks schedules, replacements, and tests while cancellation, cancel-all, cleanup reconciliation, and cron cleanup remain available.
- To roll back, turn off both switches, leave the existing open-app reminder checker enabled, run/trigger cleanup, and verify the registry contains no remaining scheduled messages before removing OneSignal code.

Never log or expose the OneSignal API key, push signing secret, Supabase secret, full assignments, notes, passwords, visible usernames, arbitrary notification text, or external notification URLs.

## Optional cross-device account sync

GlowDocket uses Supabase Auth and one RLS-protected JSON snapshot per Auth user when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured. Without both public variables, the existing browser-local account system remains available. Never put a service-role or secret key in a `VITE_` variable.

Setup:

1. Review and run `supabase/migrations/202607130001_create_taskcabinet_cloud_state.sql` in the same Supabase project. Do not modify or replace the push-reminder migration.
2. Enable Email/Password authentication in Supabase Authentication. Configure the Site URL and add both the production origin and local development origin (for example, `http://localhost:5173/`) to Authentication > URL Configuration > Redirect URLs. These approved URLs are used for email confirmation and password recovery. Decide whether email confirmation is required before testing.
3. Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and the public anon/publishable key in local development and Vercel, then rebuild the frontend.
4. Keep `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` server-only for the reminder registry. Cloud account sync does not use it in React.

If preferred-name notification wording is enabled, review and run `supabase/migrations/202607130002_add_push_reminder_preferred_name.sql`. It adds only the optional, 60-character greeting name to reminder records. The value is used for server-generated wording and is never assigned as a OneSignal identity.

The synchronized snapshot contains assignments, attachment metadata, courses and colors, checklists, workspace layouts, account preferences, theme, and display name. Attachment blobs remain in the existing `taskacadia_attachments` IndexedDB database, so a file added on one device reports that it is unavailable when opened on another device. Notification permission, OneSignal subscriptions, device enrollment/cleanup records, notification history, local password verifiers, sync metadata, and temporary UI state are never uploaded.

Sync is local-first: local writes happen immediately, cloud writes are debounced, revision-checked, and retried after reconnecting. Conflicting meaningful versions are backed up locally and require an explicit Keep cloud data or Use this device's data choice.

Signed-out visitors see the public GlowDocket welcome page with Sign In and Create Account embedded on the same page. Supabase account users can choose **Forgot password?** to request a recovery email. The recovery link returns to the configured GlowDocket origin, opens the new-password form, and keeps the recovered session signed in after a successful update. Supabase Auth sends and validates these emails; SMTP secrets and service credentials must never be placed in React code or a `VITE_` variable. Local-only browser profiles do not have email recovery until they add an email and enable account sync from Account Settings.

Cloud users can manage verification, display name, email, password, global sign-out, and permanent deletion under **Settings > Account**. `/api/account/delete` validates the signed-in user's access token, then uses the server-only `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` to delete that exact Auth user. The `taskcabinet_cloud_state` foreign key uses `on delete cascade`, so deleting the Auth user also permanently removes the user's cloud planner snapshot. The current browser's account-scoped planner cache and attachment blobs are removed only after the server confirms deletion. Offline copies on other devices cannot be remotely erased from browser storage; those devices lose cloud access as their sessions expire and should have their site data cleared if they will never reconnect.

**Settings > Storage > Backup & Restore** provides a complete restorable JSON export, a spreadsheet-friendly assignment CSV, confirmed JSON restore, and cloud snapshot history. Run `supabase/migrations/202607130003_create_taskcabinet_cloud_history.sql` to enable automatic history. The database trigger records the prior state before each meaningful cloud update and retains the newest 20 versions per user. History remains protected by RLS, and restores still pass through the existing revision-checked save path. Attachment blobs are not included in JSON or cloud history because they remain device-local in IndexedDB.

Two-device test:

1. Create or sign into the same confirmed email account in two clean browser profiles.
2. Add an assignment, course color, checklist, and widget movement on device A; wait for Saved.
3. Refresh device B and confirm all four appear, then edit on B and refresh A.
4. Take one device offline, edit, reconnect, and wait for Saved.
5. Edit the same account independently on both devices before either receives the other revision; confirm the conflict dialog appears and neither version is silently discarded.
6. Add an attachment on A. Confirm its metadata appears on B and opening it clearly reports that the local file is unavailable.
7. Confirm push permission and Push Reminders must still be enabled separately on each device.

Reminder endpoints also enforce exact origin checks, signed installation ownership after enrollment, strict fixed payloads/targets, bounded reconciliation batches, and a best-effort per-instance request limit. For a larger public deployment, add an infrastructure-level distributed rate limiter in front of the Vercel Functions.

## Feedback & Support

The former Recommendations navigation surface is now **Feedback & Support**. Its legacy `/api/recommendations` Google Docs endpoint remains in the repository so historical Recommendation data and rollback options are not destroyed. New submissions use `/api/feedback`, `public.feedback_submissions`, and the private `feedback-screenshots` Supabase Storage bucket.

### Supabase setup

Review and run `supabase/migrations/202607150001_create_feedback_submissions.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. The migration:

- creates the constrained, RLS-enabled `public.feedback_submissions` table;
- allows authenticated users to insert and read only their own rows while denying browser updates/deletes;
- creates or updates `feedback-screenshots` as a private bucket limited to PNG, JPEG, and WebP files no larger than 5 MB;
- restricts screenshot upload, read, and orphan cleanup to the authenticated user's own top-level UUID folder.

Do not make the bucket public. Administrators can initially review records in Supabase Table Editor and inspect screenshots in Storage. Use the dashboard or a short-lived signed URL for administrative viewing; never create permanent public screenshot URLs. The migration is intentionally prepared for manual review and is not run automatically by this repository.

### Feedback environment variables

Public frontend configuration:

```text
VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@glowdocket.com
```

Server-only Vercel configuration:

```text
RESEND_API_KEY=replace_with_resend_api_key
FEEDBACK_NOTIFICATION_TO=glowdocket@gmail.com
FEEDBACK_FROM_EMAIL=GlowDocket Feedback <feedback@glowdocket.com>
FEEDBACK_REPLY_TO=support@glowdocket.com
SUPABASE_URL=https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=replace_with_server_secret_or_service_role_key
```

`RESEND_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` must never use a `VITE_` prefix. The endpoint verifies the Supabase access token and resolves user ID and email server-side. Contact email is stored and emailed only when the user explicitly checks the contact-permission box. A missing or failed Resend configuration does not undo a successfully saved database record; the server logs a safe warning and Supabase remains the source of truth.

### Feedback verification

For local end-to-end testing, copy the variables into a local environment file, run the migration against a development Supabase project, and use `npm run dev:vercel` so `/api/feedback` is available. Sign into a cloud account and test no category, every category, whitespace rejection, the 5,000-character boundary, all three image types, invalid/oversized images, preview/remove/replace, contact off/on, a simulated network failure, and retry. Confirm failed submission attempts remove uploaded orphan screenshots when possible and preserve the visible form.

For production, deploy to Preview first. Confirm the bucket remains private, submit with and without screenshots/contact permission, inspect the structured row in Supabase, verify no email address appears in the notification when permission is off, verify Reply-To uses `FEEDBACK_REPLY_TO`, and temporarily omit Resend configuration to confirm database submission still succeeds. Check desktop, installed PWA, narrow mobile, light mode, dark mode, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader status announcements.

The visible app version comes from `package.json` through Vite's existing build metadata. Increment `package.json` before a release when the public application version should change; Vercel commit/deployment metadata is recorded independently by the server.

## Maintenance rules

- Preserve localStorage and IndexedDB compatibility when changing persistence.
- Add workspace migrations instead of resetting saved widget layouts.
- Keep the full Calendar page fixed; only the mini calendar is a workspace widget.
- Update tests when changing pure helpers, saved-layout behavior, ranking, or date calculations.
- Run test, lint, build, and `git diff --check` before deployment.
