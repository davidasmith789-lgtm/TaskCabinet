# TaskCabinet

TaskCabinet is a browser-local assignment planner built for students. It combines assignment tracking, due-date planning, course organization, independent checklists, calendar views, recommendations, workspace widgets, personalization, archive/trash recovery, and optional browser notifications in one React application.

## Run locally

Requirements: a current Node.js release and npm.

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful verification commands:

```powershell
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

`npm run dev:vercel` is only needed when testing Vercel functions locally.

## Architecture

- `src/App.jsx` contains the shared React state and the main product workflows: local accounts, assignments, courses, settings, widgets, calendar, checklists, imports, attachments, archive, and trash.
- `src/App.css` contains the application theme, responsive layout, widget, modal, calendar, settings, and task-card styles.
- `src/workspaceLayout.js` is the source of truth for widget defaults, sizing, placement, collapse behavior, migration, and desktop/mobile layouts.
- `src/*Utils.js` modules contain pure date, ranking, import, and voice-undo logic. These functions are covered by `tests/workspace.test.js`.
- `public/sw.js` provides the production-only network-first service worker and installable app shell.
- `api/voice-assignments.js` is an optional Vercel audio-processing endpoint. The current UI primarily uses the browser's built-in speech-recognition API.

## Browser-local data

TaskCabinet stores product data in the current browser. Signing in selects a local profile; it does not create a cloud account. Important per-profile data includes:

- assignments and their archive/trash state;
- courses and course colors;
- settings and personalization;
- standalone checklists;
- desktop and mobile widget layouts.

Attachments are stored in IndexedDB. Compatibility-sensitive keys still use the historical `taskacadia_` prefix and should not be renamed without a data migration. Clearing site data removes locally stored TaskCabinet information.

## Major product areas

- **Dashboard:** Recommended Plan of Attack, What Should I Do, reminders, course overview, statistics, mini calendar, and movable widgets.
- **Assignments:** To Do, In Progress, Completed, repeating work, estimates, priorities, notes, links, files, and checklist steps.
- **Calendar:** fixed full-calendar month/week views plus a movable dashboard mini calendar.
- **Checklists:** independent colored lists with optional deadlines and reminders.
- **Settings:** assignment defaults, field visibility, calendar behavior, notifications, school cycles, appearance, custom themes, archive, trash, and workspace guidance.
- **Imports:** pasted assignment lists and local PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, or CSV syllabus extraction.

## Voice assignments

Voice assignment creation appears only in browsers that expose `SpeechRecognition` or `webkitSpeechRecognition`. Recognition happens through the browser and feeds the same local assignment-creation path as manual entry. The manual Add Assignment form remains available in every supported browser.

## Deployment

The application is configured for Vite and Vercel. A production build is created with:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Vercel can deploy the generated application from the connected repository. The service worker is registered only in production builds.

## Optional external reminders

TaskCabinet can use OneSignal Web Push for assignment reminders while the app is closed. Full assignments remain in the browser. Supabase stores only an opaque profile-installation ID, task/occurrence identifiers, OneSignal subscription and message IDs, title, course, deadline, timezone, lead time, revision, and scheduling/cleanup state. Notification text may appear on a device lock screen.

### OneSignal setup

1. Create a OneSignal Web app for the exact production origin. HTTPS and an exact origin match are required.
2. Set the worker path to `/push/onesignal/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` and its scope to `/push/onesignal/`.
3. Keep TaskCabinet's `/sw.js` worker enabled; the narrower OneSignal scope prevents a registration conflict.
4. Put the public App ID in `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`. Put the server API key only in `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`.
5. On iPhone/iPad, install TaskCabinet to the Home Screen and open the installed app before enabling Push Reminders.

### Supabase registry

1. Create or select a Supabase project.
2. Review and run `supabase/migrations/202607120001_create_push_reminder_registry.sql` in that project. Codex does not run it automatically.
3. Set `SUPABASE_URL` to the base project URL in the exact form `https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co`. Do not include `/rest/v1`; the Supabase client appends that path. Set `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` only in the Vercel server environment. It means the current server secret/service-role credential supplied by Supabase; never expose it through a `VITE_` variable.
4. The migration enables RLS and revokes browser roles. Only Vercel Functions use the registry.

### Environment and cron

Copy `.env.example` for names and placeholders. Public variables are `VITE_EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED` and `VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`. Server-only variables are `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`, `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`, `PUSH_SIGNING_SECRET`, `PUSH_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, `EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and `CRON_SECRET`.

`vercel.json` invokes `GET /api/reminders/process-horizon` once daily at `17 6 * * *` (06:17 UTC), compatible with Vercel Hobby's daily cron limit. Vercel sends `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`; the endpoint rejects requests without an exact match. Reminders more than 28 days away remain `pending_horizon` until a daily run promotes them.

### Local testing and production review

The React UI can run locally, but real closed-app delivery requires a configured OneSignal origin, Supabase registry, server environment, notification permission, internet access, and compatible browser/OS settings. Before production, test enable/disable, test push, add/edit/complete/delete/restore, repeating occurrences, lead-time changes, offline cleanup retry, subscription refresh, cron promotion, lock-screen wording, and notification clicks on supported desktop browsers, Android PWA, and iOS Home Screen.

### Kill switches and rollback

- `VITE_EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED=false` hides/disables new browser enrollment controls after rebuilding.
- `EXTERNAL_PUSH_ENABLED=false` blocks schedules, replacements, and tests while cancellation, cancel-all, cleanup reconciliation, and cron cleanup remain available.
- To roll back, turn off both switches, leave the existing open-app reminder checker enabled, run/trigger cleanup, and verify the registry contains no remaining scheduled messages before removing OneSignal code.

Never log or expose the OneSignal API key, push signing secret, Supabase secret, full assignments, notes, passwords, visible usernames, arbitrary notification text, or external notification URLs.

## Optional cross-device account sync

TaskCabinet uses Supabase Auth and one RLS-protected JSON snapshot per Auth user when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured. Without both public variables, the existing browser-local account system remains available. Never put a service-role or secret key in a `VITE_` variable.

Setup:

1. Review and run `supabase/migrations/202607130001_create_taskcabinet_cloud_state.sql` in the same Supabase project. Do not modify or replace the push-reminder migration.
2. Enable Email/Password authentication in Supabase Authentication. Configure the Site URL and add both the production origin and local development origin (for example, `http://localhost:5173/`) to Authentication > URL Configuration > Redirect URLs. These approved URLs are used for email confirmation and password recovery. Decide whether email confirmation is required before testing.
3. Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and the public anon/publishable key in local development and Vercel, then rebuild the frontend.
4. Keep `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` server-only for the reminder registry. Cloud account sync does not use it in React.

The synchronized snapshot contains assignments, attachment metadata, courses and colors, checklists, workspace layouts, account preferences, theme, and display name. Attachment blobs remain in the existing `taskacadia_attachments` IndexedDB database, so a file added on one device reports that it is unavailable when opened on another device. Notification permission, OneSignal subscriptions, device enrollment/cleanup records, notification history, local password verifiers, sync metadata, and temporary UI state are never uploaded.

Sync is local-first: local writes happen immediately, cloud writes are debounced, revision-checked, and retried after reconnecting. Conflicting meaningful versions are backed up locally and require an explicit Keep cloud data or Use this device's data choice.

Signed-out visitors see the public TaskCabinet welcome page with Sign In and Create Account embedded on the same page. Supabase account users can choose **Forgot password?** to request a recovery email. The recovery link returns to the configured TaskCabinet origin, opens the new-password form, and keeps the recovered session signed in after a successful update. Supabase Auth sends and validates these emails; SMTP secrets and service credentials must never be placed in React code or a `VITE_` variable. Local-only browser profiles do not have email recovery until they add an email and enable account sync from Account Settings.

Two-device test:

1. Create or sign into the same confirmed email account in two clean browser profiles.
2. Add an assignment, course color, checklist, and widget movement on device A; wait for Saved.
3. Refresh device B and confirm all four appear, then edit on B and refresh A.
4. Take one device offline, edit, reconnect, and wait for Saved.
5. Edit the same account independently on both devices before either receives the other revision; confirm the conflict dialog appears and neither version is silently discarded.
6. Add an attachment on A. Confirm its metadata appears on B and opening it clearly reports that the local file is unavailable.
7. Confirm push permission and Push Reminders must still be enabled separately on each device.

Reminder endpoints also enforce exact origin checks, signed installation ownership after enrollment, strict fixed payloads/targets, bounded reconciliation batches, and a best-effort per-instance request limit. For a larger public deployment, add an infrastructure-level distributed rate limiter in front of the Vercel Functions.

## Maintenance rules

- Preserve localStorage and IndexedDB compatibility when changing persistence.
- Add workspace migrations instead of resetting saved widget layouts.
- Keep the full Calendar page fixed; only the mini calendar is a workspace widget.
- Update tests when changing pure helpers, saved-layout behavior, ranking, or date calculations.
- Run test, lint, build, and `git diff --check` before deployment.
